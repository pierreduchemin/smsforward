# SMS Forward

SMS Forward is a simple app that allows you to redirect SMS you receive on your phone to another device.

This application have been developed to bypass regional limitations.
Example: a service in country A requires a phone number from country A, but your phone number is from country B. You ask a friend from country A to install this app and you will be able to receive SMS from the service in country B. However, since this is a pretty simple application, it can also serve other purposes.

Features:
- Can handle multiple redirections
- Global activation toggle

SMS Forward is free, open source and without ads.

It runs on Android 5.0 "Lollipop" (API 21) and later.

This application is built using MVVM architecture.
